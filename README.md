# 🚀 Java Performance Reviewer Skill

> **A knowledge base for AI agents that perform static performance reviews of Java Enterprise repositories.**

Detect real and potential performance bottlenecks, scalability risks, and architecture issues **before they reach production**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project enables AI agents to identify real and potential performance issues before they reach production.

Unlike traditional linters, it focuses on **performance engineering** rather than coding style or formatting.
